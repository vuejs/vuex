# Modules

Due to using a single state tree, all state of our application is contained inside one big object. However as our application grows in scale, the store can get really bloated.

To help with that, Vuex allows us to divide our store into **modules**. Each module can contain its own state, mutations, actions, getters, and even nested modules - it's fractal all the way down:

``` js
const moduleA = {
  state: { ... },
  mutations: { ... },
  actions: { ... },
  getters: { ... }
}

const moduleB = {
  state: { ... },
  mutations: { ... },
  actions: { ... }
}

const store = new Vuex.Store({
  modules: {
    a: moduleA,
    b: moduleB
  }
})

store.state.a // -> moduleA's state
store.state.b // -> moduleB's state
```

### Module Local State

Inside a module's mutations and getters, The first argument received will be **the module's local state** instead of root state:

``` js
cosnt moduleA = {
  state: { count: 0 },
  mutations: {
    increment: (state, rootState) {
      // state is the local module state
      state.count++

      // rootState is passed as the second argument, but you should not
      // mutate it from within a module.
    }
  },

  getters: {
    doubleCount (state) {
      return state.count * 2
    }
  }
}
```

Similarly, inside module actions, `context.state` will expose the local state, and root state will be exposed as `context.rootState`:

``` js
const moduleA = {
  // ...
  actions: {
    incrementIfOdd ({ state, commit }) {
      if (state.count % 2 === 1) {
        commit('increment')
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Also, inside module getters, the root state will be exposed as their 3rd argument:

``` js
const moduleA = {
  // ...
  getters: {
    sumWithRootCount (state, getters, rootState) {
      return state.count + rootState.count
    }
  }
}
```

### Namespacing

Note that actions, mutations and getters inside modules are still registered under the **global namespace** - this allows multiple modules to react to the same mutation/action type. You can namespace the module assets yourself to avoid name clashing, and you probably should if you are writing a reusable Vuex module that will be used in unknown environments.

### Dynamic Module Registration

You can register a module **after** the store has been created with the `store.reigsterModule` method:

``` js
store.registerModule('myModule', {
  // ...
})
```

The module's state will be exposed as `store.state.myModule`.

Dynamic module registration makes it possible for other Vue plugins to also leverage Vuex for state management by attaching a module to the application's store. For example, the [`vuex-router-sync`](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex-router-sync) library integrates vue-router with vuex by managing the application's route state in a dynamically attached module.

You can also remove a dynamically registered module with `store.unregisterModule(moduleName)`. Note you cannot remove static modules (declared at store creation) with this method.
