# State and Getters

### Single State Tree

Vuex uses a **single state tree** - that is, this single object contains all your application level state and serves as the "single source of truth". This also means usually you will have only one store for each application. A single state tree makes it straightforward to locate a specific piece of state, and allows us to easily take snapshots of the current app state for debugging purposes.

The single state tree does not conflict with modularity - in later chapters we will discuss how to split your state and mutations into sub modules.

### Getting Vuex State into Vue Components

So how do we display state inside the store in our Vue components? Since Vuex stores are reactive, the simplest way to "retrieve" state from it is simply returning some store state from within a [computed property](http://vuejs.org/guide/computed.html):

``` js
// in a Vue component definition
computed: {
  count: function () {
    return store.state.count
  }
}
```

Whenever `store.state.count` changes, it will cause the computed property to re-evaluate, and trigger associated DOM updates.

However, this pattern causes the component to rely on the global store singleton. This makes it harder to test the component, and also makes it difficult to run multiple instances of the app using the same set of components. In large applications, we may want to "inject" the store into child components from the root component. Here's how to do it:

1. Install Vuex and connect your root component to the store:

  ``` js
  import Vue from 'vue'
  import Vuex from 'vuex'
  import store from './store'
  import MyComponent from './MyComponent'

  // important, teaches Vue components how to
  // handle Vuex-related options
  Vue.use(Vuex)

  var app = new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    // provide the store using the "store" option.
    // this will inject the store instance to all child components.
    store,
    components: {
      MyComponent
    }
  })
  ```

  By providing the `store` option to the root instance, the store will be injected into all child components of the root and will be available on them as `this.$store`. However it's quite rare that we will need to actually reference it.

2. Inside child components, retrieve state with **getter** functions in the `vuex.getters` option:

  ``` js
  // MyComponent.js
  export default {
    template: '...',
    data () { ... },
    // this is where we retrieve state from the store
    vuex: {
      getters: {
        // a state getter function, which will
        // bind `store.state.count` on the component as `this.count`
        count: function (state) {
          return state.count
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Note the special `vuex` option block. This is where we specify what state the component will be using from the store. For each property name, we specify a getter function which receives the entire state tree as the only argument, and then selects and returns a part of the state, or a computed value derived from the state. The returned result will be set on the component using the property name, just like a computed property.

  In a lot of cases, the "getter" function can be very succinct using ES2015 arrow functions:

  ``` js
  vuex: {
    getters: {
      count: state => state.count
    }
  }
  ```

### Getters Must Be Pure

All Vuex getters must be [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) - they take the entire state tree in, and return some value solely based on that state. This makes them more testable, composable and efficient. It also means **you cannot rely on `this` inside getters**.

If you do need access to `this`, for example to compute derived state based on the component's local state or props, you need to define separate, plain computed properties:

``` js
vuex: {
  getters: {
    currentId: state => state.currentId
  }
},
computed: {
  isCurrent () {
    return this.id === this.currentId
  }
}
```

### Getters Can Return Derived State

Vuex state getters are computed properties under the hood, this means you can leverage them to reactively (and efficiently) compute derived state. For example, say in the state we have an array of `messages` containing all messages, and a `currentThreadID` representing a thread that is currently being viewed by the user. What we want to display to the user is a filtered list of messages that belongs to the current thread:

``` js
vuex: {
  getters: {
    filteredMessages: state => {
      return state.messages.filter(message => {
        return message.threadID === state.currentThreadID
      })
    }
  }
}
```

Because Vue.js computed properties are automatically cached and only re-evaluated when a reactive dependency changes, you don't need to worry about this function being called on every mutation.

### Sharing Getters Across Multiple Components

As you can see, the `filteredMessages` getter may be useful inside multiple components. In that case, it's a good idea to share the same function between them:

``` js
// getters.js
export function filteredMessages (state) {
  return state.messages.filter(message => {
    return message.threadID === state.currentThreadID
  })
}
```

``` js
// in a component...
import { filteredMessages } from './getters'

export default {
  vuex: {
    getters: {
      filteredMessages
    }
  }
}
```

Because getters are pure, getters shared across multiple components are efficiently cached: when dependencies change, they only re-evaluate once for all components that uses them.

> Flux reference: Vuex getters can be roughly compared to [`mapStateToProps`](https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#connectmapstatetoprops-mapdispatchtoprops-mergeprops-options) in Redux. However, because they leverage Vue's computed properties memoization under the hood, they are more efficient than `mapStateToProps`, and more similar to [reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect).

### Components Are Not Allowed to Directly Mutate State

It's important to remember that **components should never directly mutate Vuex store state**. Because we want every state mutation to be explicit and trackable, all vuex store state mutations must be conducted inside the store's mutation handlers.

To help enforce this rule, when in [Strict Mode](strict.md), if a store's state is mutated outside of its mutation handlers, Vuex will throw an error.

With this rule in place, our Vue components now hold a lot less responsibility: they are bound to Vuex store state via read-only getters, and the only way for them to affect the state is by somehow triggering **mutations** (which we will discuss later). They can still possess and operate on their local state if necessary, but we no longer put any data-fetching or global-state-mutating logic inside individual components. They are now centralized and handled inside Vuex related files, which makes large applications easier to understand and maintain.
